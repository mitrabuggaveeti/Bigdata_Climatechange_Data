# First Choice :
Kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
## Selection of data to analyze

We have selected data on climate change from Kaggle that helps us understand Earth's surface temperature changes Earth's surface temperature throughout time. The temperature has changed significantly between the early 1990s and the present. We will use the Berkeley Earth data source, which has 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives in a properly structured format. This dataset is important for obtaining information on the average land temperature as well as data combining average land and ocean temperatures.

## Business Problem or Opportunity

The chosen dataset can be used to address various business problems and opportunities such as:
1. Climate change research: The dataset can be used to identify long-term trends in temperature and investigate the impact of climate change on different regions around the world. This could be useful for businesses focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as for policymakers and advocacy groups.

2. Sustainable development: Businesses can use this dataset to inform sustainable development strategies, particularly for businesses operating in industries that are high emitters of greenhouse gases. By understanding how temperature is changing in different regions and how it may impact business operations, companies can identify opportunities for innovation and investment in sustainable technologies and practices.

3. Risk assessment: The dataset can also be used for risk assessment and disaster planning. By analyzing temperature patterns, businesses can identify regions that are most at risk for extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, or flooding, and develop contingency plans to mitigate these risks.

## Domain Knowledge

1. Data visualization: This form for conveying knowledge and conclusions from data makes utilizes visual aids like graphs, charts, and maps. In addition to making the data easier to comprehend and analyze, this approach may be employed to find hyperlinks, trends, and patterns in the data.
2. Greenhouse effect: The greenhouse effect is an occurrence of nature that occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, in the Earth's atmosphere take in sunlight and prevent it from exiting into orbit.
3. Climate science: The study of the Earth's climate system, including the factors that affect it, the internal processes that take location, and the patterns and trends that emerge through time. 
4. Temperature anomalies: An temperature aberration is a deviation from the usual deviation for an area and a time period. Abnormalities are utilized for recognizing patterns and trends in temperature data and also monitoring temperature variations over time.
5. Data cleaning and preprocessing: Earlier, for collecting data, people utilized mercury thermometers, therefore any changes in the visit duration have an impact on the measurements Preparing information for analysis involves finding and fixing problems including missing values, outliers, and contradictory or incorrect information. 

## Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)
The agenda of our team is to identifying the strategies that could help us define the solutions to the below questions using suitable visualisations as part of our research work. By analysis the chosen dataset we would further investigate the following questions: 1)In correlation to changes in temperature, are there population changes in animals or plants?2)How do temperature variations over different periods, including daily or seasonal variations, relate to long-term changes in average temperature?3)Between changes in temperature and differences in people's health, are there any relationships?

# Second Choice : 
Kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)
## Selection of data to analyze

The purpose of the analysis of this dataset is because it contains detailed information on terrorist attacks worldwide, including the date and location of the attack, the weapons used, the target of the attack, and the number of casualties. This dataset can be used to analyze patterns and trends in terrorist activity over time and across different regions of the world.It can also be used to investigate the components—such as political unpredictability, religious extremism, and economic situations—that affect the severity and frequency of terrorist acts.
## Business Problem or Opportunity

The dataset on global terrorism from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) can be leveraged for various business problems and opportunities such as:
1. Risk assessment: The dataset can be used for risk assessment purposes by businesses operating in regions that are prone to terrorist attacks. By analyzing the historical data on terrorist incidents, businesses can identify patterns and trends that could help them mitigate potential risks and develop contingency plans.
2. Insurance and risk management: Insurance companies can use this dataset to inform their underwriting and risk management practices. By analyzing the historical data on terrorist attacks, insurers can better understand the likelihood and severity of potential losses, and adjust their premiums and coverage accordingly.
3. Security and defense: The dataset can also be used by businesses that provide security and defense solutions. By analyzing the data on terrorist attacks, these companies can identify patterns and trends that could inform their product development and service offerings.

## Domain Knowledge:

Global terrorism database is provided by university of Maryland. It is an open-source database of worldwide terrorist attacks which have information over 200k terrorist incidents from the year 1970 to 2017. The dataset have the required information of the date, location, type, and severity of each attack, as well as the information on the perpetrators, the targets, and the weapons used. The data also includes additional variables such as the number of injuries, and damage to the property caused by the attack.

The primary purpose of this Dataset is that it can be helpful and used for research and analysis of terrorism trends, patterns and  to make better decisions related to counter terrorism efforts. Domain knowledge required for this dataset include focus on terrorism studies and criminology. Researchers and policy makers can use this dataset to find out the patterns and trends in the activities of terrorists to find out the areas with most effected terrorism and develop strategies for preventing the terrorist attacks. It also helps in building predictive models that helps in understadning of the terrorist attacks and their causes.

##  Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)

The agenda of our team is to identify the strategies that could help us define the solutions to the below questions using suitable visualizations as part of our research work. By analysis the chosen dataset we would further investigate the following questions:
1. What are the most common types of terrorist attacks worldwide, and how have they changed over time?2. To what extent does political instability or conflict contribute to the incidence of terrorist attacks, and vice versa? 3. How have terrorist attacks affected civilian populations in terms of deaths, injuries, displacement, and psychological trauma?

# Data Preparation
As part of the data preparation process, all null values are first checked since they limit the ability of the machine learning algorithm to learn. Each column's null values are examined, and all of them are replaced with mean. After completing the above step, the data on each column was carefully observed and the Standard deviation, Mean, Maximum, and other statistical distributions are examined to determine how evenly the data is distributed.
